# web-rich-text-editor
A responsive web rich text editor - available at: https://shuncio.github.io/web-rich-text-editor/

The editor has got a large amount of text customization options – f.e. bold, italic, subscript, align or import/export text data encoded in JSON.

Written in HTML, CSS and pure JS.

TODO: 
1. minimalisation (or completely remove) that ugly media queries part of CSS code and transform main CSS core into a modern technology – Flexbox.
2. Transition from deprecated execCommand JS method to a modern way of creating JS text editors – probably with usage of Range interface and Selection object
